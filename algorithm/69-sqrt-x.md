# \#69 Sqrt\(x\)

### Easy:star:

Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return _the square root of_ `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are **truncated**, and only **the integer part** of the result is returned.

    def mySqrt(self, x: int) -> int:
        return int(sqrt(x))
